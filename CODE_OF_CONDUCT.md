# AegisGate Code of Conduct

Version 1.0 — Last updated: 2026-02-26

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior in the AegisGate community, and the steps to take if someone engages in unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of background or identity.

## Purpose

AegisGate is a community-driven project. We value the participation of every person and want all contributors and users to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. This Code of Conduct is intended to make clear what is expected of all community members and to provide a process for addressing behavior that falls short of those expectations.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces created by or hosted by the AegisGate project, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repository discussions, issues, pull requests, and code review
- Mailing lists, chat rooms, and forums associated with the project
- In-person and virtual events organized by AegisGate
- Any other public or private communication channels where participants are representing or interacting with the AegisGate community

## Standards

Examples of behavior we expect from all participants include:

- Be respectful and considerate in your language and actions.
- Assume good faith in others' intentions.
- Be mindful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Provide constructive feedback, and do so with kindness.
- Seek to resolve disagreements privately and respectfully when possible.

Unacceptable behavior includes (but is not limited to):

- Violence, threats of violence, or intimidation.
- Harassment, hate speech, or derogatory comments based on identity (including race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected class).
- Deliberate or reckless misrepresentation of affiliation, identity, or contributions.
- Sharing private information (doxing) without explicit consent.
- Sexual content or sexual language in a space meant for professional or community discussion.
- Repeated disruptive behavior or any actions that degrade the experience of other participants.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it promptly. Reports will be handled with discretion and, to the extent possible, confidentiality.

To report an incident, you may:

1. Open a private GitHub Security Advisory (if applicable for code-related security issues).
2. Email the project maintainers at: REPLACE_WITH_MAINTAINERS_EMAIL
3. If your report involves the maintainers or you prefer an external route, email: REPLACE_WITH_SECONDARY_CONTACT (e.g., project-committee@example.com)

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the incident (what happened, when, and where)
- The names or identifiers of participants involved (if known)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or copies of messages
- Your contact information and whether you wish your report to remain confidential

If you are unsure whether the behavior warrants a report, you are welcome to reach out informally to the maintainers for guidance.

## Enforcement

All reports will be reviewed by the maintainers or a designated conduct team. Enforcement actions are at the discretion of the maintainers and will vary based on the severity and frequency of the misconduct. Possible actions include:

- Request for clarification or apology
- Warning and temporary suspension of project privileges (e.g., blocking or muting)
- Removal of offending content
- Revocation of commit or contributor access
- Permanent ban from communication channels or the project
- Referral to law enforcement where necessary

We will strive to follow a fair process:

- Acknowledge receipt of the report within a reasonable time.
- Assess the report and gather additional information if necessary.
- Notify involved parties as appropriate and provide an opportunity to respond.
- Decide on appropriate action, communicate that decision, and apply remedies.

We will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith. If you feel you are being retaliated against, report that as well.

## Private and Sensitive Situations

If the reported situation is sensitive (e.g., sexual assault, threats of violence, or if the reporter asks for special handling), the maintainers will take additional care to protect confidentiality and safety and will work with the reporter to determine the best course of action.

## Appeal

If you are subject to an enforcement action and believe it was unjust, you may request an appeal by contacting the project maintainers at REPLACE_WITH_APPEAL_CONTACT. Appeals will be reviewed by a different maintainer or an impartial committee where feasible.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from widely used community standards (including the Contributor Covenant). We thank the authors of those templates for providing a well-structured foundation for inclusive project communities.
